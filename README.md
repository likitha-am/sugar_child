##  Sugar_Child – Diabetes Prediction Model

##  Project Overview
Sugar_Child is a machine learning–based diabetes prediction system that determines whether a person is diabetic based on key health parameters such as glucose level, BMI, age, and insulin level.


##  Features
- Predicts diabetic vs non-diabetic status  
- Uses Random Forest for better accuracy  
- Based on a well-known healthcare dataset  
- Clean preprocessing and model training pipeline  
- Suitable for deployment and real-world testing
