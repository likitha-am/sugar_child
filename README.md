# Diabetes Prediction Model 🚀

A Machine Learning model that predicts whether a person is diabetic or not based on certain health parameters.

## 📌 Project Overview
This project uses a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict whether a person is diabetic based on features like glucose level, age, BMI, etc. It is built as part of a hackathon project focusing on model deployment and achieving the highest accuracy.

## 📁 Dataset
- Dataset: PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset
- Features: 
  - `Pregnancies`
  - `Glucose`
  - `BloodPressure`
  - `SkinThickness`
  - `Insulin`
  - `BMI`
  - `DiabetesPedigreeFunction`
  - `Age`
- Label: `Outcome` (0 = Non-Diabetic, 1 = Diabetic)
